# How to Build Digital Credentials using Solana Attestation Service (TypeScript)

## What is Solana Attestation Service?

The Solana Attestation Service (SAS) is a powerful on-chain credentialing system that enables developers to create, manage, and verify digital attestations on the Solana blockchain. Think of it as a decentralized way to issue and verify credentials, certificates, badges, or any form of digital proof that someone or something meets certain criteria. 

SAS introduces powerful capabilities for associating offchain data with on-chain accounts, building trust and identity systems, including:

* **Compliance Systems** \- Provable KYC/AML status
* **Professional Credentials** \- Verification of professional certificates or degrees  
* **Gaming Achievements** \- Issuance of badges/milestone recognition  
* **Event Attendance** \- Proof of participation  
* **Loyalty** \- Rewards users for engagement, volume, etc.

Attestations can then be consumed by service providers (e.g., DEXs, DAOs, or other platforms) to vet users and gate services based on their credentials (e.g., enable VIP Members to access unique content on a website or Accredited Investors to participate in certain on-chain investment opportunities).

This guide will walk you through creating a complete attestation script that:

* Creates a new credential with authorized signers  
* Defines a schema for the type of data we want to attest  
* Issues an attestation to a specific user  
* Updates authorized signers for enhanced security  
* Verifies attestations for both attested and non-attested users
* Closes an attestation (effectively revoking a user's credential)

The end goal will be to see a working attestation system in action:

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v22 or later)  
* [**Solana CLI**](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation) v 2.2.x or greater  
* **Familiarity** with [Solana Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda) and [on-chain accounts](https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts)
* [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) Experience

## Understanding Solana Attestation Service

SAS provides a standardized way to create verifiable claims about entities (users, organizations, or even other programs) directly on Solana.

### Core Concepts

The attestation system consists of three main components:

* **Credentials** - The top-level identity or organization that issues attestations. Think of this as a "university" that issues diplomas or the "company" that issues employee badges.  
* **Schemas** - Define the structure and fields of data that can be attested. Schemas are essentially a template that specifies what information (name, age, skills, etc.) will be included in attestations.  
* **Attestations** - Individual claims made about specific entities following a particular schema. These are the actual "diplomas" or "badges" issued to users.

Each of these components is represented on-chain as an account governed by the SAS Program: [`22zoJMtdu4tQc2PzL74ZUT7FrwgB1Udec8DdW4yw4BdG`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/22zoJMtdu4tQc2PzL74ZUT7FrwgB1Udec8DdW4yw4BdG).



### Key Features

* **Authority Management** - Credentials can have multiple authorized signers who can issue attestations  
* **Expiration Support** - Attestations can have expiration dates for time-sensitive credentials  
* **Structured Data** - Schemas define typed data structures for consistent attestations  
* **Versioning** - Schemas can be versioned for variations over time
* **Pausable** - Schemas can be paused, or disabled
* **Verification** - Anyone can verify if a user has a valid attestation for a specific credential
* **Revocable** - Attestations can be terminated by authorized signers defined in the _Credential*

### Key Considerations

* **Data Privacy:** Because attestations are on-chain, the data can be read by anyone. Do not store personal identifiable or other sensitive information directly on chain. Consider what data to include directly vs. storing hashes of sensitive information off-chain.  
* **Trusted Credentials** - anyone can create a credential/schema. Make sure you know/trust the credential provider if you are accepting an Attestation as verification of a user's credentials.
* **User Verification** - ensure connected wallets are actual users by requiring signing a message (e.g., [Sign in with Solana](https://github.com/phantom/sign-in-with-solana) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-web3#sign-in-with-solana))   
* **Versioning** Note that *Schemas* are versioned, so you will need to establish business practices for monitoring and handling schema changes. This guide will walk you through using a single version–we will cover more advanced applications in a future guide.
* **Performance:** Verification checks can be batched and cached. For certain use cases, consider indexing services for applications that need to check many attestations frequently.

## Project Setup

*Prefer to jump straight to the code? Check out our [Examples Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-attestation-service/tree/master/examples/typescript/attestation-flow-guides/src/gill/sas-standard-gill-demo.ts) for the complete code for this guide\!*

Let's start by creating our project structure:

```shell
mkdir solana-attestation-demo && cd solana-attestation-demo
```

Initialize a new Node.js project with the required dependencies


:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm init -y
npm i sas-lib gill
npm i --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/node
```
 
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm init
pnpm i sas-lib gill
pnpm i -D typescript ts-node @types/node
```
 
```bash [yarn]
yarn init -y
yarn add sas-lib gill
yarn add -D typescript ts-node @types/node
```
 
:::

_Note: [Gill](https://gill.site/) extends the Solana Kit library with some helper functions that we will use in this demo._ 


Create a `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "nodenext",
    "lib": ["es2020"],
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext"
  },
  "rootDir": "./", 
  "outDir": "./dist",
  "include": ["./"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

Update your `package.json` scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ts-node attestation-demo.ts",
  "build": "tsc"
}
```


## Implementation

Let's create our `attestation-demo.ts` file and build it step by step:

### Imports and Configuration

Start with the necessary imports and configuration:

```ts
import {
    getCreateCredentialInstruction,
    getCreateSchemaInstruction,
    serializeAttestationData,
    getCreateAttestationInstruction,
    fetchSchema,
    getChangeAuthorizedSignersInstruction,
    fetchAttestation,
    deserializeAttestationData,
    deriveAttestationPda,
    deriveCredentialPda,
    deriveSchemaPda,
    deriveEventAuthorityAddress,
    getCloseAttestationInstruction,
    SOLANA_ATTESTATION_SERVICE_PROGRAM_ADDRESS
} from "sas-lib";
import {
    airdropFactory,
    generateKeyPairSigner,
    lamports,
    Signature,
    TransactionSigner,
    IInstruction,
    Address,
    Blockhash,
    getComputeUnitEstimateForTransactionMessageFactory,
    createSolanaClient,
    createTransaction,
    SolanaClient,
} from "gill";

const CONFIG = {
    CLUSTER_OR_RPC: 'devnet',
    CREDENTIAL_NAME: 'TEST-ORGANIZATION',
    SCHEMA_NAME: 'THE-BASICS',
    SCHEMA_LAYOUT: Buffer.from([12, 0, 12]),
    SCHEMA_FIELDS: ["name", "age", "country"],
    SCHEMA_VERSION: 1,
    SCHEMA_DESCRIPTION: 'Basic user information schema for testing',
    ATTESTATION_DATA: {
        name: "test-user",
        age: 100,
        country: "usa",
    },
    ATTESTATION_EXPIRY_DAYS: 365
};
```

This sets up our basic configuration, including:

- **Connection details**: we'll be using our Solana `devnet` for this demo.
    :::details[Testing on Localnet?]

    If you prefer to use `localnet`, you will need to make sure to fetch the SAS program off mainnet by calling:
    ```
    solana program dump -u m 22zoJMtdu4tQc2PzL74ZUT7FrwgB1Udec8DdW4yw4BdG sas.so
    ```
    and launching it with your test validator:

    ```
    solana-test-validator -r --bpf-program 22zoJMtdu4tQc2PzL74ZUT7FrwgB1Udec8DdW4yw4BdG path/to/sas.so
    ```
    :::
- **Credential parameters** (name and authorized signers)  
- **Schema definition** (structure, fields, and description)  
- **Attestation data** (the actual information we'll attest)

#### Schemas and Layouts

Before moving on, let's examine the Schema Layout and Fields we defined above. The `SCHEMA_LAYOUT` array defines the data types for each field in our attestation, where each number corresponds to a specific data type from the Solana Attestation Service's type system. In our example, `Buffer.from([12, 0, 12])` maps to our three fields: 
- the first `12` represents a String type for the "name" field, 
- `0` represents a U8 integer type for the "age" field, and 
- the final `12` represents another String type for the "country" field. 

The `SCHEMA_FIELDS` array provides human-readable names that correspond one-to-one with the layout types. This approach ensures that when attestations are created, the data is properly typed and validated according to the schema definition. The available data types range from basic integers (U8, U16, U32, U64, U128) and signed integers (I8-I128) to booleans, characters, strings, and even vectors of these types, giving you flexibility in designing your attestation data structures. Check out the full list of options and mapping [here](/schemas#schema-layout-data-types).

### Utility Functions

Next, let's add a couple of utility functions to handle keypair management and transaction confirmations:

```ts
async function setupWallets(client: SolanaClient) {
    try {
        const payer = await generateKeyPairSigner(); // or loadKeypairSignerFromFile(path.join(process.env.PAYER));
        const authorizedSigner1 = await generateKeyPairSigner();
        const authorizedSigner2 = await generateKeyPairSigner();
        const issuer = await generateKeyPairSigner();
        const testUser = await generateKeyPairSigner();

        const airdrop = airdropFactory({ rpc: client.rpc, rpcSubscriptions: client.rpcSubscriptions });
        const airdropTx: Signature = await airdrop({
            commitment: 'processed',
            lamports: lamports(BigInt(1_000_000_000)),
            recipientAddress: payer.address
        });

        console.log(`    - Airdrop completed: ${airdropTx}`);
        return { payer, authorizedSigner1, authorizedSigner2, issuer, testUser };
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to setup wallets: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
}
```

Our `setupWallets` function creates five keypairs and airdrops SOL to our payer account:

These utility functions handle:

This should create five keypair files in the `wallets` directory: 

- `payer` will be used to pay our transaction fees  
- `issuer` will be the authority that creates our credential  
- Two `authorizedSigner` keys will be authorized to create attestations  
- `testUser` will receive the attestation we create

Next add a reusable function that will help us easily create and send transactions. Add the following to your code: 

```ts
async function sendAndConfirmInstructions(
    client: SolanaClient,
    payer: TransactionSigner,
    instructions: IInstruction[],
    description: string
): Promise<Signature> {
    try {
        const simulationTx = createTransaction({
            version: "legacy",
            feePayer: payer,
            instructions: instructions,
            latestBlockhash: {
                blockhash: '11111111111111111111111111111111' as Blockhash,
                lastValidBlockHeight: 0n,
            },
            computeUnitLimit: 1_400_000,
            computeUnitPrice: 1,
        });

        const estimateCompute = getComputeUnitEstimateForTransactionMessageFactory({ rpc: client.rpc });
        const computeUnitLimit = await estimateCompute(simulationTx);
        const { value: latestBlockhash } = await client.rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();
        const tx = createTransaction({
            version: "legacy",
            feePayer: payer,
            instructions: instructions,
            latestBlockhash,
            computeUnitLimit,
            computeUnitPrice: 1, // In production, use dynamic pricing
        });

        const signature = await client.sendAndConfirmTransaction(tx);
        console.log(`    - ${description} - Signature: ${signature}`);
        return signature;
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to ${description.toLowerCase()}: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
}
```
Our function does two things: 
1. First, we create a dummy transaction to simulate the total compute units required (more information on compute [here](https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#compute-budget)).
2. Then we assemble our optimized transaction and send it to the network for processing.

### Attestation Verification Function

Now let's add a verification function that demonstrates how to check if a user has a valid attestation. To verify a user's attestation, we will need to pass two pieces of information: the user's address (or other identifier associated with the user) and the Schema address that you want to validate against. Add the `verifyAttestation` function to your code and then we will walk through how it works:

```ts
async function verifyAttestation({
    client,
    schemaPda,
    userAddress
}: {
    client: SolanaClient;
    schemaPda: Address;
    userAddress: Address;
}): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
        const schema = await fetchSchema(client.rpc, schemaPda);
        if (schema.data.isPaused) {
            console.log(`    -  Schema is paused`);
            return false;
        }
        const [attestationPda] = await deriveAttestationPda({
            credential: schema.data.credential,
            schema: schemaPda,
            nonce: userAddress
        });
        const attestation = await fetchAttestation(client.rpc, attestationPda);
        const attestationData = deserializeAttestationData(schema.data, attestation.data.data as Uint8Array);
        console.log(`    - Attestation data:`, attestationData);
        const currentTimestamp = BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000));
        return currentTimestamp < attestation.data.expiry;
    } catch (error) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

This function:

- **Fetches the Schema**: check to ensure the schema is active
- **Derives the attestation PDA** for a specific user  
- **Deserializes the data** to show what was attested  
- **Validates the attestation** exists and hasn't expired  

Additionally, if you know it, you could pass a `credentialPda` as a double check that your schema is correctly associated with the known credential.

### Step 1: Setup

Now, let's build the main demonstration function that showcases the complete attestation workflow. Add the `main` function to your code--we'll use this to outline for our steps:

```ts
async function main() {
    console.log("Starting Solana Attestation Service Demo\n");
    
    const client: SolanaClient = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: CONFIG.CLUSTER_OR_RPC });

    // Step 1: Setup wallets and fund payer
    console.log("1. Setting up wallets and funding payer...");
    const { payer, authorizedSigner1, authorizedSigner2, issuer, testUser } = await setupWallets(client);

    // Step 2: Create Credential


    // Step 3: Create Schema


    // Step 4: Create Attestation


    // Step 5: Update Authorized Signers


    // Step 6: Verify Attestations


    // Step 7. Close Attestation


}

main()
    .then(() => console.log("\nSolana Attestation Service demo completed successfully!"))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error("❌ Demo failed:", error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

The current code includes spaces for 7 steps. We've started by creating our client and calling our `setupWallets` function. Let's add the remaining steps next.

### Step 2: Create Credential

First, we will need to create our *Credential*. This establishes the issuing authority (like a certification body) with initial authorized signers.

Add the following code to your `main` function:

```ts
    // Step 2: Create Credential
    console.log("\n2. Creating Credential...");
    const [credentialPda] = await deriveCredentialPda({
        authority: issuer.address,
        name: CONFIG.CREDENTIAL_NAME
    });

    const createCredentialInstruction = getCreateCredentialInstruction({
        payer,
        credential: credentialPda,
        authority: issuer,
        name: CONFIG.CREDENTIAL_NAME,
        signers: [authorizedSigner1.address]
    });

    await sendAndConfirmInstructions(client, payer, [createCredentialInstruction], 'Credential created');
    console.log(`    - Credential PDA: ${credentialPda}`);
```

Here, we just need to use a couple of helper function `sas-lib` package:
- `deriveCredentialPda`: derives the PDA of our credential account based on the authority (our issuer wallet) and the name of our credential (meaning an issuer could create multiple credentials by creating new ones with different names) ([ref](https://attest.solana.com/docs/helpers#credential-pda)).
-  `getCreateCredentialInstruction`: will assemble the instruction to create the credential account ([ref](https://attest.solana.com/docs/instructions/create-credential)). For now, we will just add a single authorized signer, so that we can add our second signer later. 

We send our instruction to the network by calling our `sendAndConfirmInstructions` helper function.

### Step 3: Create Schema

Next, we need to define our *Schema* to define the structure of data that can be attested (name, age, country in our example). Add the following to your code:

```ts
    // Step 3: Create Schema
    console.log("\n3.  Creating Schema...");
    const [schemaPda] = await deriveSchemaPda({
        credential: credentialPda,
        name: CONFIG.SCHEMA_NAME,
        version: CONFIG.SCHEMA_VERSION
    });

    const createSchemaInstruction = getCreateSchemaInstruction({
        authority: issuer,
        payer,
        name: CONFIG.SCHEMA_NAME,
        credential: credentialPda,
        description: CONFIG.SCHEMA_DESCRIPTION,
        fieldNames: CONFIG.SCHEMA_FIELDS,
        schema: schemaPda,
        layout: CONFIG.SCHEMA_LAYOUT,
    });

    await sendAndConfirmInstructions(client, payer, [createSchemaInstruction], 'Schema created');
    console.log(`    - Schema PDA: ${schemaPda}`);
```

We follow a similar pattern here--derive PDA, assemble instruction, and send it to the network using `sendAndConfirmInstructions`:
- `deriveSchemaPda`: derives the PDA of our schema account based on the credential we created in Step 2, the name of our schema, and the version ([ref](https://attest.solana.com/docs/helpers#schema-pda)).
-  `getCreateSchemaInstruction`: will assemble the instruction to create the schema account ([ref](https://attest.solana.com/docs/instructions/create-schema)). 


### Step 4: Create Attestation

Next, we need to issue an actual attestation to a specific user with the defined data and expiration. Add the following to Step 4 of your `main` function:

```ts
    // Step 4: Create Attestation
    console.log("\n4. Creating Attestation...");
    const [attestationPda] = await deriveAttestationPda({
        credential: credentialPda,
        schema: schemaPda,
        nonce: testUser.address
    });

    const schema = await fetchSchema(client.rpc, schemaPda);
    const expiryTimestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (CONFIG.ATTESTATION_EXPIRY_DAYS * 24 * 60 * 60);

    const createAttestationInstruction = await getCreateAttestationInstruction({
        payer,
        authority: authorizedSigner1,
        credential: credentialPda,
        schema: schemaPda,
        attestation: attestationPda,
        nonce: testUser.address,
        expiry: expiryTimestamp,
        data: serializeAttestationData(schema.data, CONFIG.ATTESTATION_DATA),
    });

    await sendAndConfirmInstructions(client, payer, [createAttestationInstruction], 'Attestation created');
    console.log(`    - Attestation PDA: ${attestationPda}`);
```

Like before, we will first derive our Attestation PDA using a helper function, `deriveAttestationPda` ([ref](https://attest.solana.com/docs/helpers#attestation-pda)). Note that the parameters include a `nonce` which can be a user's address or some other unique identifier address (e.g. some value stored off-chain).

Prior to calling `getCreateAttestationInstruction`, we need to do a couple of things:
- We must fetch our *Schema* from the chain--we will use `fetchSchema` to get the deserialized schema data which is required to serialize our attestation data. We do so by passing the schema data and our attestation into `serializeAttestationData`.
- We define an expiration of 1-year from now.

_Notice that the `authority` in our instruction parameters is `authorizedSigner1`, the authorized signer we defined in Step 2 when we created our credential._

Finally, we send the instruction to the network to create the attestation PDA.

### Step 5: Update Authorized Signers

We mentioned earlier that we can update a credential's authorized signers. Let's add `authorizedSigner2` as an authorized signer to our credential to demonstrate how to manage who can issue attestations for the credential. Add the following to Step 5 of your `main` function:

```ts
    // Step 5: Update Authorized Signers
    console.log("\n5. Updating Authorized Signers...");
    const changeAuthSignersInstruction = await getChangeAuthorizedSignersInstruction({
        payer,
        authority: issuer,
        credential: credentialPda,
        signers: [authorizedSigner1.address, authorizedSigner2.address]
    });

    await sendAndConfirmInstructions(client, payer, [changeAuthSignersInstruction], 'Authorized signers updated');
```

We just need to assemble an instruction passing our new signers array (this replaces the old list of signers, so make sure to include existing signers you wish to keep) into `getChangeAuthorizedSignersInstruction` and send it to the network with our helper function. 

### Step 6: Verify Attestations

Let's run a verification check to show how you might check if users have valid attestations, testing both attested and non-attested users. Normally, you might run something like this on your backend when a user signs into your platform. Add the following to Step 6 of your `main` function: 

```ts
    // Step 6: Verify Attestations
    console.log("\n6. Verifying Attestations...");

    const isUserVerified = await verifyAttestation({
        client,
        schemaPda,
        userAddress: testUser.address
    });
    console.log(`    - Test User is ${isUserVerified ? 'verified' : 'not verified'}`);

    const randomUser = await generateKeyPairSigner();
    const isRandomVerified = await verifyAttestation({
        client,
        schemaPda,
        userAddress: randomUser.address
    });
    console.log(`    - Random User is ${isRandomVerified ? 'verified' : 'not verified'}`);
```

Here, we are calling our helper function `verifyAttestation` twice: once with our `testUser` address (which we would expect to be verified at this point) and a new `randomUser` who does not have an attestation (we would expect this user's verification to fail).

### Step 7: Close Attestation

Finally, let's revoke an attestation from a user. Add the following code to your project as Step 7: 

```ts
    // Step 7. Close Attestation
    console.log("\n7. Closing Attestation...");

    const eventAuthority = await deriveEventAuthorityAddress();
    const closeAttestationInstruction = await getCloseAttestationInstruction({
        payer,
        attestation: attestationPda,
        authority: authorizedSigner1,
        credential: credentialPda,
        eventAuthority,
        attestationProgram: SOLANA_ATTESTATION_SERVICE_PROGRAM_ADDRESS
    });
    await sendAndConfirmInstructions(client, payer, [closeAttestationInstruction], 'Closed attestation');
```

In order to generate an attesation instruction, we need to get the Event Authority address using `deriveEventAuthorityAddress`. The event authority is used to emit close events in the SAS program. We then assemble our instruction using the `getCloseAttestationInstruction`--note that we must pass one of our `authorizedSigner` addresses into the `authority` parameter.

## Run the Demonstration

To test your attestation workflow, run the script in your project terminal:

:::code-group
 
```bash [npm]
npm start
```
 
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm start
```
 
```bash [yarn]
yarn start
```
 
:::

Here's what you should expect to see in the output:

Nice job! 

## Wrap Up

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented a complete Solana Attestation Service system. You now have a working demonstration that shows how to:

- **Create credentials** that represent issuing authorities  
- **Define schemas** for structured attestation data  
- **Issue attestations** to specific users  
- **Manage authorized signers** for enhanced security
- **Verify attestations** programmatically  
- **Close attestation** as needed

The Solana Attestation Service provides a powerful foundation for building trust and identity systems on Solana. Whether you're creating compliance systems, financial credentials, professional certifications, or gaming achievements, SAS gives you the tools to issue and verify claims in a decentralized, transparent way.
