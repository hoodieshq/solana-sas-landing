# Create Tokenized Attestation

Creates a new tokenized attestation that represents a verified claim as a token. This instruction allows authorized signers to create attestations that are represented as tokens, which can be transferred and held by recipients.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `payer` | `Signer` | The account that will pay for the transaction |
| `authority` | `Signer` | The authorized signer of the schema's credential |
| `credential` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The credential account associated with the schema |
| `schema` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The schema account that defines the attestation structure |
| `attestation` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The attestation account to create |
| `systemProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The System Program account (defaults to '11111111111111111111111111111111') |
| `schemaMint` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The mint account of the schema token |
| `attestationMint` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The mint account of the attestation token |
| `sasPda` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Program derived address used as program signer authority |
| `recipientTokenAccount` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Associated token account of recipient for attestation token |
| `recipient` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Wallet to receive the attestation token |
| `tokenProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The Token Program account (defaults to 'TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA') |
| `associatedTokenProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The Associated Token Program account |
| `nonce` | `Address` | A unique identifier for the attestation |
| `data` | `ReadonlyUint8Array` | The attestation data that must conform to the schema |
| `expiry` | `number \| bigint` | The expiration timestamp for the attestation |
| `name` | `string` | The name of the attestation token |
| `uri` | `string` | The URI containing metadata for the attestation token |
| `symbol` | `string` | The symbol for the attestation token |
| `mintAccountSpace` | `number` | The space to allocate for the mint account |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { getCreateTokenizedAttestationInstruction } from "solana-attestation-service";

const transaction = getCreateTokenizedAttestationInstruction({
    payer: payerSigner,
    authority: authoritySigner,
    credential: credentialPublicKey,
    schema: schemaPublicKey,
    attestation: attestationPublicKey,
    systemProgram: systemProgramPublicKey,
    schemaMint: schemaMintPublicKey,
    attestationMint: attestationMintPublicKey,
    sasPda: sasPdaPublicKey,
    recipientTokenAccount: recipientTokenAccountPublicKey,
    recipient: recipientPublicKey,
    tokenProgram: tokenProgramPublicKey,
    associatedTokenProgram: associatedTokenProgramPublicKey,
    nonce: noncePublicKey,
    data: attestationData,
    expiry: expiryTimestamp,
    name: "Verified Identity",
    uri: "https://example.com/metadata.json",
    symbol: "VID",
    mintAccountSpace: 82
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- The payer must be a signer of the transaction
- The authority must be a signer of the transaction and must be an authorized signer of the credential
- The attestation account must be writable
- The credential and schema accounts must be readable
- This operation requires the System Program for rent exemption calculations
- The schema must not be paused
- The data must conform to the schema's structure and validation rules
- The nonce must be unique for each attestation
- The expiry timestamp must be in the future
- The attestation will be invalid after the expiry timestamp
- The token name, symbol, and URI should be descriptive of the attestation's purpose
- The mint account space must be sufficient for the token metadata
- The recipient must have an associated token account for the attestation token
- The attestation token can be transferred to other wallets after creation
- The schema token is used to verify the attestation's validity
