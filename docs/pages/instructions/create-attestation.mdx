# Create Attestation

Creates a new attestation under a specific credential and schema. This instruction allows authorized signers to create attestations that contain verified data and have a defined expiration time.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `payer` | `Signer` | The account that will pay for the transaction |
| `authority` | `Signer` | The authorized signer of the credential |
| `credential` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The credential account associated with the schema |
| `schema` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The schema account that defines the attestation structure |
| `attestation` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The attestation account to create |
| `systemProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The System Program account (defaults to '11111111111111111111111111111111') |
| `nonce` | `Address` | A unique identifier for the attestation |
| `data` | `ReadonlyUint8Array` | The attestation data that must conform to the schema |
| `expiry` | `number \| bigint` | The expiration timestamp for the attestation |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { getCreateAttestationInstruction } from "sas-lib";

const transaction = getCreateAttestationInstruction({
    payer: payerSigner,
    authority: authoritySigner,
    credential: credentialPublicKey,
    schema: schemaPublicKey,
    attestation: attestationPublicKey,
    systemProgram: systemProgramPublicKey,
    nonce: noncePublicKey,
    data: attestationData,
    expiry: expiryTimestamp
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- Only authorized signers of the credential can create attestations
- The authority must be a signer of the transaction
- The payer must be a signer of the transaction
- The attestation account must be writable
- The credential and schema accounts must be readable
- This operation requires the System Program for rent exemption calculations
- The schema must not be paused
- The data must conform to the schema's structure and validation rules
- The nonce must be unique for each attestation
- The expiry timestamp must be in the future
- The attestation will be invalid after the expiry timestamp
- The credential must be associated with the schema
