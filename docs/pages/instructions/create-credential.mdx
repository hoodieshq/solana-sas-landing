# Create Credential

Creates a new credential that defines an attestation authority. This instruction allows users to create credentials that specify who can issue attestations and what types of attestations they can issue.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `payer` | `Signer` | The account that will pay for the transaction |
| `credential` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The credential account to create |
| `authority` | `Signer` | The authority who will control the credential |
| `systemProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The System Program account (defaults to '11111111111111111111111111111111') |
| `name` | `string` | The name of the credential |
| `signers` | `Address[]` | The list of authorized signers who can create attestations |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { getCreateCredentialInstruction } from "sas-lib";

const transaction = getCreateCredentialInstruction({
    payer: payerSigner,
    credential: credentialPublicKey,
    authority: authoritySigner,
    systemProgram: systemProgramPublicKey,
    name: "My Credential",
    signers: [signer1PublicKey, signer2PublicKey]
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

  - Close the credential
- The authorized signers can:
  - Create attestations under this credential
