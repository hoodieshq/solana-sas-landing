# Attestations

An attestation represents a verified claim or statement in the Solana Attestation System. Attestations are created by authorized signers under a credential and follow a specific schema. Each attestation contains the actual data of the claim and metadata about its creation and validity.

## Structure

The Attestation struct represents an attestation in the Solana Attestation System. Each attestation links to a credential, schema, and contains the attested data along with metadata about its creation and validity period.

## Type Definitions

### Attestation

```typescript
export type Attestation = {
    discriminator: number;           // Internal discriminator
    nonce: Address;                  // Unique identifier for the attestation
    credential: Address;             // Associated credential address
    schema: Address;                 // Associated schema address
    data: ReadonlyUint8Array;       // Attestation data
    signer: Address;                 // Address of the signer who created the attestation
    expiry: bigint;                  // Expiration timestamp
    tokenAccount: Address;           // Associated token account
};
```

### AttestationArgs

```typescript
export type AttestationArgs = {
    discriminator: number;
    nonce: Address;
    credential: Address;
    schema: Address;
    data: ReadonlyUint8Array;
    signer: Address;
    expiry: number | bigint;        // Can be either number or bigint
    tokenAccount: Address;
};
```

## Methods

### Fetching Attestations

| Method | Description | Parameters | Returns |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `fetchAttestation` | Fetches a single attestation by its address | `rpc`: RPC context, `address`: Attestation's address, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<Account<Attestation>>` |
| `fetchMaybeAttestation` | Safely fetches an attestation, returns null if not found | `rpc`: RPC context, `address`: Attestation's address, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<MaybeAccount<Attestation>>` |
| `fetchAllAttestation` | Fetches multiple attestations by their addresses | `rpc`: RPC context, `addresses`: Array of attestation addresses, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<Account<Attestation>[]>` |
| `fetchAllMaybeAttestation` | Safely fetches multiple attestations, skips not found | `rpc`: RPC context, `addresses`: Array of attestation addresses, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<MaybeAccount<Attestation>[]>` |

### Serialization

| Method | Description | Parameters | Returns |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `getAttestationEncoder` | Gets the encoder for attestation data | None | `Encoder<AttestationArgs>` |
| `getAttestationDecoder` | Gets the decoder for attestation data | None | `Decoder<Attestation>` |
| `getAttestationCodec` | Gets the codec for attestation data | None | `Codec<AttestationArgs, Attestation>` |

## Usage Examples

### Fetching a Single Attestation

```typescript
const attestation = await fetchAttestation(rpc, attestationAddress);
console.log('Attestation nonce:', attestation.nonce);
```

### Fetching Multiple Attestations

```typescript
const attestations = await fetchAllAttestation(rpc, [attestation1Address, attestation2Address]);
attestations.forEach(attestation => console.log('Attestation:', attestation.nonce));
```

### Safe Fetching

```typescript
const attestation = await fetchMaybeAttestation(rpc, attestationAddress);
if (attestation) {
    console.log('Attestation found:', attestation.nonce);
} else {
    console.log('Attestation not found');
}
```

## Important Notes

- The `discriminator` field is used internally and should not be modified
- The `nonce` provides a unique identifier for each attestation
- `credential` and `schema` fields link the attestation to its associated credential and schema
- The `data` field contains the actual attestation data and should be properly encoded/decoded according to the schema
- `signer` must be one of the authorized signers of the associated credential
- `expiry` determines when the attestation becomes invalid
- `tokenAccount` links the attestation to a specific token account
- Attestations can only be created by authorized signers of the associated credential
- The attestation data must conform to the structure defined by the associated schema
