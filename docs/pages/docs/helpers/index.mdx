# PDA Helpers

The Solana Attestation Service uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for various purposes. This guide explains the available helper functions for deriving these addresses.

## Available Seeds

The following seeds are used in the system:
- `ATTESTATION_SEED`: Used for attestation accounts
- `CREDENTIAL_SEED`: Used for credential accounts
- `SCHEMA_SEED`: Used for schema accounts
- `EVENT_AUTHORITY_SEED`: Used for the event authority
- `SAS_SEED`: Used for the SAS authority
- `SCHEMA_MINT_SEED`: Used for schema token mints
- `ATTESTATION_MINT_SEED`: Used for attestation token mints

## Helper Functions

### Event Authority

```typescript
const deriveEventAuthorityAddress = async (): Promise<Address<string>>
```

Derives the address of the event authority PDA. This address is used to sign events emitted by the program.

### SAS Authority

```typescript
const deriveSasAuthorityAddress = async (): Promise<Address<string>>
```

Derives the address of the SAS authority PDA. This address is used for program signing authority.

### Credential PDA

```typescript
const deriveCredentialPda = async ({
    authority,
    name
}: {
    authority: Address;
    name: string;
}): Promise<readonly [Address<string>, number]>
```

Derives the PDA for a credential account.

**Parameters:**
- `authority`: The address that controls the credential account
- `name`: A name for the credential (only first 32 bytes used)

**Returns:**
- Tuple containing the PDA address and bump seed

**Example:**
```typescript
const [credentialPda, bump] = await deriveCredentialPda({
    authority: authorityPublicKey,
    name: "My Credential"
});
```

### Schema PDA

```typescript
const deriveSchemaPda = async ({
    credential,
    name,
    version
}: {
    credential: Address;
    name: string;
    version: number;
}): Promise<readonly [Address<string>, number]>
```

Derives the PDA for a schema account.

**Parameters:**
- `credential`: The credential that the schema is associated with
- `name`: A name for the schema (only first 32 bytes used)
- `version`: The version number (0-255) of the schema

**Returns:**
- Tuple containing the PDA address and bump seed

**Example:**
```typescript
const [schemaPda, bump] = await deriveSchemaPda({
    credential: credentialPublicKey,
    name: "Identity Schema",
    version: 1
});
```

### Attestation PDA

```typescript
const deriveAttestationPda = async ({
    credential,
    schema,
    nonce
}: {
    credential: Address;
    schema: Address;
    nonce: Address;
}): Promise<readonly [Address<string>, number]>
```

Derives the PDA for an attestation account.

**Parameters:**
- `credential`: The credential that controls the attestation
- `schema`: The schema that the attestation adheres to
- `nonce`: Either the wallet address the attestation is associated with or a random address to prevent PDA collision

**Returns:**
- Tuple containing the PDA address and bump seed

**Example:**
```typescript
const [attestationPda, bump] = await deriveAttestationPda({
    credential: credentialPublicKey,
    schema: schemaPublicKey,
    nonce: walletPublicKey
});
```

### Schema Mint PDA

```typescript
const deriveSchemaMintPda = async ({
    schema
}: {
    schema: Address;
}): Promise<readonly [Address<string>, number]>
```

Derives the PDA for a schema token mint.

**Parameters:**
- `schema`: The schema that the token belongs to

**Returns:**
- Tuple containing the PDA address and bump seed

**Example:**
```typescript
const [schemaMintPda, bump] = await deriveSchemaMintPda({
    schema: schemaPublicKey
});
```

### Attestation Mint PDA

```typescript
const deriveAttestationMintPda = async ({
    attestation
}: {
    attestation: Address;
}): Promise<readonly [Address<string>, number]>
```

Derives the PDA for an attestation token mint.

**Parameters:**
- `attestation`: The attestation that the token belongs to

**Returns:**
- Tuple containing the PDA address and bump seed

**Example:**
```typescript
const [attestationMintPda, bump] = await deriveAttestationMintPda({
    attestation: attestationPublicKey
});
```

## Important Notes

1. **Name Length**: When using names in PDAs, only the first 32 bytes are used due to seed size limits.

2. **Version Numbers**: Schema versions are limited to 0-255.

3. **Nonce Usage**: For attestation PDAs, the nonce can be either:
   - The wallet address the attestation is associated with
   - A randomly generated address to prevent PDA collision

4. **Bump Seeds**: All PDA derivation functions return both the address and the bump seed. The bump seed is used to ensure the derived address is off the ed25519 curve.

## Common Patterns

### Creating a New Credential and Schema

```typescript
// Derive credential PDA
const [credentialPda, credentialBump] = await deriveCredentialPda({
    authority: authorityPublicKey,
    name: "My Organization"
});

// Derive schema PDA
const [schemaPda, schemaBump] = await deriveSchemaPda({
    credential: credentialPda,
    name: "Identity Verification",
    version: 1
});
```

### Creating a Tokenized Attestation

```typescript
// Derive attestation PDA
const [attestationPda, attestationBump] = await deriveAttestationPda({
    credential: credentialPublicKey,
    schema: schemaPublicKey,
    nonce: walletPublicKey
});

// Derive attestation mint PDA
const [attestationMintPda, mintBump] = await deriveAttestationMintPda({
    attestation: attestationPda
});
```
