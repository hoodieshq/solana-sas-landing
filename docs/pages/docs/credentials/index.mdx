# Credentials

A credential represents an attestation authority in the Solana Attestation System. Credentials define who can issue attestations and what types of attestations they can issue. Each credential has a set of authorized signers who can create attestations under its authority.

## Structure

The Credential struct represents a credential in the Solana Attestation System. Each credential defines an authority that can issue attestations and the signers authorized to do so.

## Type Definitions

### Credential

```typescript
export type Credential = {
    discriminator: number;           // Internal discriminator
    authority: Address;              // Authority public key
    name: ReadonlyUint8Array;       // Credential name
    authorizedSigners: Array<Address>; // List of authorized signers
};
```

## Methods

### Fetching Credentials

| Method | Description | Parameters | Returns |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `fetchCredential` | Fetches a single credential by its address | `rpc`: RPC context, `address`: Credential's address, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<Account<Credential>>` |
| `fetchMaybeCredential` | Safely fetches a credential, returns null if not found | `rpc`: RPC context, `address`: Credential's address, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<MaybeAccount<Credential>>` |
| `fetchAllCredential` | Fetches multiple credentials by their addresses | `rpc`: RPC context, `addresses`: Array of credential addresses, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<Account<Credential>[]>` |
| `fetchAllMaybeCredential` | Safely fetches multiple credentials, skips not found | `rpc`: RPC context, `addresses`: Array of credential addresses, `config?`: Fetch config | `Promise<MaybeAccount<Credential>[]>` |

### Serialization

| Method | Description | Parameters | Returns |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `getCredentialEncoder` | Gets the encoder for credential data | None | `Encoder<CredentialArgs>` |
| `getCredentialDecoder` | Gets the decoder for credential data | None | `Decoder<Credential>` |
| `getCredentialCodec` | Gets the codec for credential data | None | `Codec<CredentialArgs, Credential>` |

## Usage Examples

### Fetching a Single Credential

```typescript
const credential = await fetchCredential(rpc, credentialAddress);
console.log('Credential name:', credential.name);
```

### Fetching Multiple Credentials

```typescript
const credentials = await fetchAllCredential(rpc, [credential1Address, credential2Address]);
credentials.forEach(credential => console.log('Credential:', credential.name));
```

### Safe Fetching

```typescript
const credential = await fetchMaybeCredential(rpc, credentialAddress);
if (credential) {
    console.log('Credential found:', credential.name);
} else {
    console.log('Credential not found');
}
```

## Important Notes

- The `discriminator` field is used internally and should not be modified
- The `authority` field determines who has control over the credential
- `authorizedSigners` is an array of addresses that are allowed to create attestations under this credential
- The `name` field is stored as a byte array and should be properly encoded/decoded according to your application's needs
- Only authorized signers can create attestations under a credential
- The authority can modify the list of authorized signers
