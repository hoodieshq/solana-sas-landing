# Close Attestation

Closes an attestation account, permanently removing it from the blockchain. This instruction allows authorized signers to remove attestations that are no longer needed or have expired.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `payer` | `Signer` | The account that will pay for the transaction |
| `authority` | `Signer` | The authorized signer of the credential |
| `credential` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The credential account associated with the attestation |
| `attestation` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The attestation account to close |
| `eventAuthority` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The event authority account for emitting events |
| `systemProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The System Program account (defaults to '11111111111111111111111111111111') |
| `attestationProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The Attestation Program account |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { getCloseAttestationInstruction } from "solana-attestation-service";

const transaction = getCloseAttestationInstruction({
    payer: payerSigner,
    authority: authoritySigner,
    credential: credentialPublicKey,
    attestation: attestationPublicKey,
    eventAuthority: eventAuthorityPublicKey,
    systemProgram: systemProgramPublicKey,
    attestationProgram: attestationProgramPublicKey
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- Only authorized signers of the credential can close attestations
- The authority must be a signer of the transaction
- The payer must be a signer of the transaction
- The attestation account must be writable
- The credential and event authority accounts must be readable
- This operation requires the System Program for rent exemption calculations
- Closing an attestation is permanent and cannot be undone
- The attestation's data will be permanently removed from the blockchain
- Any associated tokens or resources should be handled before closing the attestation
- The event authority is used to emit events about the attestation closure
