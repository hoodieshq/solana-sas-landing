# Emit Event

Emits an event from the Solana Attestation Service program. This instruction allows the program to emit events that can be listened to by external applications for tracking attestation-related activities.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `eventAuthority` | `Signer` | The program-derived address used as the event authority |
| `attestationProgram` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The Solana Attestation Service program address |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { getEmitEventInstruction } from "solana-attestation-service";

const transaction = getEmitEventInstruction({
    eventAuthority: eventAuthoritySigner,
    attestationProgram: attestationProgramPublicKey
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- The event authority must be a signer of the transaction
- The event authority is typically a program-derived address (PDA)
- This instruction is used internally by the program to emit events
- Events can be used to track:
  - Attestation creation
  - Attestation updates
  - Attestation closures
  - Schema changes
  - Credential modifications
- External applications can listen to these events to maintain their own state
- The attestation program address must be the correct program address
- This instruction is typically called as part of other instructions that need to emit events
